For those of us that actually do work.

There are two main tools in this repo.

sonosMancer --> A command line tool for interacting with a Sonos speaker network that is present the LAN you are connected to.

song_black_list.py --> A script that will listen for artists and songs currently playing on the Sonos speaker network, check a blacklist and skip the song if its on the blacklist.
